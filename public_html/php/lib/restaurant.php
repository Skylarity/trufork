							Shields up. I recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the photon torpedoes. Something
							strange on the detector circuit. The weapons must have disrupted our communicators. You saw
							something as tasty as meat, but inorganically materialized out of patterns used by our

							We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of
							bio-electronic engineering by which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat and
							infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive me if I've said and listened to this a
							thousand times. This planet's interior heat provides an abundance of geothermal energy. We
							need to neutralize the homing signal.

							Unidentified vessel travelling at sub warp speed, bearing 235.7. Fluctuations in energy
							readings from it, Captain. All transporters off. A strange set-up, but I'd say the graviton
							generator is depolarized. The dark colourings of the scrapes are the leavings of natural
							rubber, a type of non-conductive sole used by researchers experimenting with electricity.
							The molecules must have been partly de-phased by the anyon beam.
